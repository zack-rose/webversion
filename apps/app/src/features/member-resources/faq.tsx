		answer: `
      1. <strong>Submit your application</strong> - Join the community by answering a few questions about yourself, and enter your invite code if you have one.<br />
      2. <strong>Get approved and join the community</strong> - Once you are approved, activate your membership.<br />
      3. <strong>Sync your network</strong> - We know some people prefer to rent within their existing or extended networks. Sync your phone contacts when prompted to view mutual connections to other members when browsing homes. You can also add your employer information and education background to view who else is in your networks. <br />
      4. <strong>Browse or list your home</strong> - Create a listing. Rented or owned, small or large – we just want well-cared-for homes. Your home doesn’t need to be available right away or for a particular length of time - we cover short and long term rentals, as well as house swaps. <br />
      5. <strong>Contact & book</strong> - Find a home you like and send a message to the owner via our messaging system to agree on the dates.
